## 📦 Cleanup Categories

The script targets a wide array of system and user items, categorized by safety levels:

| # | Category | Target / Description | Notes |
|---|----------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | 📦 User Caches | `~/Library/Caches/*` | Safe |
| 2 | 🖥️ System Caches | `/Library/Caches/*` | requires `sudo` |
| 3 | 📂 App Leftovers | `~/Library/Application Support/` | interactive selection |
| 4 | 📋 Logs | `~/Library/Logs/*`, `/Library/Logs/*` | Safe |
| 5 | 🗃️ Temporary Files | `$TMPDIR`, user var/folders | Safe |
| 6 | 🛠️ Developer | Xcode DerivedData | interactive selection |
| 7 | 🗑️ Trash | `~/.Trash/*` | Safe |
| 8 | 🌐 Browser Cache | `~/Library/Caches` for Safari, Chrome, etc. | Safe |
| 9 | ⚠️ Browser Full Data | Complete browser profiles (cookies, history) | **Danger** (requires opt-in) |
| 10| 📱 iOS Backups | `~/Library/MobileSync/Backup` | interactive selection |
| 11| 🗑️ App Uninstaller | Remove apps & associated leftover files | interactive selection |
| 12| 📨 Mail Downloads | Mail attachment downloads cache | Safe |
| 13| 🩺 Diagnostic Reports| `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` | Safe |
| 14| 🖼️ QuickLook Cache | `qlmanage` thumbnail cache | Safe |
| 15| 💾 Saved App State | `~/Library/Saved Application State` | Caution |

## 🔧 Web API

The web dashboard invokes `clean_mac.sh` in JSON mode for programmatic control:

```bash
# Get scan results
bash clean_mac.sh --scan-json

# Clean specific categories (comma-separated indices)
bash clean_mac.sh --clean-json 1,4,7

# Get system status
bash clean_mac.sh --status-json
```

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- The script only removes caches, logs, and temporary files by default.
- macOS will recreate many of these files as needed.
- The `Downloads` folder is not touched.
- System Cache cleanup requires `sudo` (terminal mode).
- The web dashboard skips categories that require `sudo` unless explicitly enabled.
- **Dry-run preview:** set `APPLE_CLEANUP_DRYRUN=1` (or tick *Önizleme* in the
  dashboard) to see exactly what would be removed — nothing is deleted.
- **Exclusion list:** set `APPLE_CLEANUP_EXCLUDE` to a colon-separated list of
  paths/globs to protect from deletion, e.g.
  `APPLE_CLEANUP_EXCLUDE="$HOME/Library/Caches/com.myapp:*/Important*"`.

## 🔒 Web Dashboard Security

The dashboard exposes an API that can delete files, so it is locked down:

- Binds to **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`) — never reachable from the LAN.
- Rejects requests whose `Host`/`Origin` is not loopback (anti DNS-rebinding/CSRF).
- Requires a **per-session token** (regenerated on each start) on every
  destructive request; no wildcard CORS is sent.
